    <string name="about_gdpr_body" formatted="false">
Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how the ForgetMeNot app handles your data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n
\n
1. Data Collection\n
The App does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data. All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n
\n
2. Personal Data\n
Personal data is any information that can identify you. The App does not require account creation and does not collect names, email addresses, location data, or identifiers.\n
\n
3. Data Usage\n
Any data you enter is used solely to provide the App’s functionality. The developer does not access or process your data outside your device.\n
\n
4. Data Storage\n
All data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for managing backups and deletion of your data.\n
\n
5. Third-Party Services\n

\n
6. Your Rights under GDPR\n
Under GDPR, you have the right to:\n
• Access your data\n
• Delete your data\n
• Restrict or object to processing\n
\n
Since all data remains on your device, these rights can be exercised directly by uninstalling the App or deleting its data.\n
\n
7. Data Security\n
Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that the App operates securely, but no method of electronic storage is completely secure.\n
\n
8. Changes to This Policy\n
This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected within the App.\n
\n
If you have questions or concerns about privacy, please contact the developer.
